Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Florian Cartier! I work as an Engineering Manager at Hotjar by ContentSquare and as co-founder / principal engineer for Carbon Crushers.

# About Me
In the tech world, Iâ€™m juggling engineering at Hotjar by day and saving the planet with CarbonCrushers by night. As an Engineering Manager, I lead with empathy, turning teamwork into innovation. On the side, Iâ€™m co-founding a game studio that blends fun with environmental action. From startup hustles at Sloowy to sustainable gaming, Iâ€™m all about pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. Always up for new ideas and collaborationsâ€”letâ€™s code, chat, and save the world together!
